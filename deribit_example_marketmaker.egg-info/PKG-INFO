        ---
        
        The bot layers bids and offers around the market mid, which it attempts to calculate from the order book. The spread between quoted bids and offers is determined by a user-set risk charge on volatility. Volatility is estimated by an EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average Process) with frequency and parameters that may also be set by the user.
